# "The shell uses dynamic scoping to control a variableâ€™s visibility within functions.
# With dynamic scoping, visible variables and their values are a result of the sequence
# of function calls that caused execution to reach the current function. The value of a
# variable that a function sees depends on its value within its caller, if any, whether
# that caller is the "global" scope or another shell function. This is also the value
# that a local variable declaration "shadows", and the value that is restored when the
# function returns."
